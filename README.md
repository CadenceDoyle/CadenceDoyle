## Hi! üëã

My name is Cadence Doyle, a data scientist looking to make a difference.

I have 5 years of experience in data management, data analytics, and data visualization. I‚Äôve worked for two small consulting companies supporting government clients, specifically DHS and DOE. I am proficient in: 
- SQL 
- R 
- Python 
- PowerBI 
- Tableau 
- Oracle OBIEE 

I had the opportunity to showcase my research at two conferences, specifically ‚ÄúComprehending the Chaos: Leveraging Text to Improve Analysis‚Äù (ICEAA, 2021) and ‚ÄúUsing Linear Programming to Create Optimal Budget Scenarios‚Äù (AACE, 2022). 

I have an MS from Georgetown University in Mathematics and Statistics and a BS from Dickinson College in Mathematics and Classical Studies. I am a certified scrum master (CSM) and a professional cost estimator/analyst (PCEA).

I have a strong background in statistics, and I am looking for a career that fuses my programming and communication skills. I would love to explore any fields that use data to make an impact on the community, particularly through policy.
